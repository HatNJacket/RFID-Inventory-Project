"""Read-only bridge to TC-Planner (the inventory planner).

The planner owns the purchase-order ledger: what was ordered from which
vendor and how much of it has already been received. This module READS
that ledger so scanning surfaces can say "this product is on an open PO,
N more are expected". It must never write — no receipts, no status
changes, no Shopify pushes, no vendor email. Filing a receive against a
PO is a future, explicitly operator-confirmed feature (ROADMAP: Steve's
TODO #2), and when it lands it belongs behind its own write gate.

Auth is the planner's Bearer token (PLANNER_TOKEN). With it unset the
bridge is OFF and every helper answers the "not configured" shape rather
than raising — planner hints are decoration on the scan flow and a
planner outage must never break a scan.
